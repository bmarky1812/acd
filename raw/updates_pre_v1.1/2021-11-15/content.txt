001.	*abus ‘to feel upset about s.t., brood over’
KLY	__it__abuh__/it__	‘to be upset about something and complain (a person who is upset does not confront the person involved; instead, he complains to s.o. else)’
MSK	__it__abos__/it__	‘to think continually about some difficulty; brood continually’

002.	*agap ‘greedy’
SblBt	__it__ágap__/it__	‘to covet or desire more’
BKD	__it__agap__/it__	‘greedy (in taking or getting something)’

003.	*ag(e)páŋ ‘rattan or bamboo strip used to measure, when weaving nets or baskets’
ILK	__it__agpáŋ__/it__	‘bamboo strip used in netting; a measure; standard; guidepost’
TAG	__it__agpáŋ__/it__	‘exact; fitted; right’
HAN	__it__agpáŋ__/it__	‘a doubled strip of rattan held tightly around a strip of __it__buri__/it__ palm leaf which is being split for fine basket weaving (this helps the basketmaker in keeping the __it__buri__/it__ strips of even width)’
CEB	__it__agpáŋ__/it__	‘a thin piece of bamboo, three or four inches in length, used to set the size of the hold in weaving fish nets’

NOTE: This probably is not a Tagalog loan, as it refers to aspects of traditional culture that would have been universal among Austronesian speakers in the Philippines and many other places, and the Tagalog form lacks the specificity of the other glosses.

004.	*agud ‘to moan, agonize’
SblBt	__it__ágol__/it__	‘to moan or agonize in pain’
MSK	__it__agod__/it__	‘to moan, to agonize (as a pig in pain)’

005.	*ákay ‘to guide, direct the motion of someone or something, as a herd of animals’
ILK	__it__ákay__/it__	‘a herd’,
	__it__akáy-en__/it__	‘to guide; to herd’
PGS	__it__ákay__/it__	‘to lead by the hand, guide’
TAG	__it__ákay__/it__	‘led by the hand’
	__it__in-akáy__/it__	‘a young chick led by a hen’
	__it__um-ákay__/it__	‘to guide, direct or lead (in a moral or physical sense)’
HAN	__it__ákay__/it__	‘direction; guidance; aid; helping (someone) along’

NOTE: Possibly a Tagalog loan distribution, although the divergent semantics of the Ilokano form weighs against this interpretation.

006.	*alabaqab ‘unquenchable thirst’
ILK	__it__alabáab__/it__	‘unappeasable thirst’
PGS	__it__alabáb__/it__	‘to drink much wine’
BKD	__it__alabɁab__/it__	‘greedy (in eating), voracious’

NOTE: PPH *buk(e)law, *lamun/lamut, and *sibáq ‘gluttonous’ referred to a runaway appetite for food; this term may have designated uncontrollable thirst.

007.	*aláw ‘to catch someone or something that has escaped’
ILK	__it__aláw__/it__	‘rescue; method of getting back a lost spirit by putting water in a white bowl, dekernel 27 kernels of plain rice, pray the Apostle’s creed….’

WBM	__it__alew__/it__	‘to catch, as one catches a chicken; to look for and fetch someone’
MSK	__it__araw__/it__	‘to drive (as animals and fish); to chase’
BKD	__it__alaw__/it__	‘to run after, chase (a person or animal in order to catch him/it)’

NOTE: Philippine reflexes of PAN *qusiR ‘pursuit, as of enemies or game’ refer to alien people or wild animals, but *aláw appears to refer to something formerly with the pursuer that has fled or escaped, and must be recaptured (the fleeing spirit of an ailing person, a domestic animal that has run off, etc). The Ilokano word refers to a traditional animistic healing ceremony of soul capture overlaid with a veneer of Christianity.

008.	*alug(e)báti ‘kind of vegetable’
ILK	__it__alugbáti__/it__	‘species of plant with edible leaves and reddish stems: Malabar nightshade’
AGU	__it__alogbati__/it__	‘plant similar to a sweet potato vine; the vine is red or maroon and climbs up fences; the young leaves are edible’
AKL	__it__aeogbáti__/it__	‘a vegetable: __it__Basella rubra__/it__ L.’
CEB	__it__alugbáti__/it__	‘k.o. vine with leaves widely used as a vegetable: __it__Basilla rubra__/it__’.

NOTE: Quadrisyllabic comparisons that do not contain the *qali/kali- prefix are suspect, and if the heterorganic cluster in the reflexes was earlier separated by a schwa the base morpheme had an unprecedented five syllables. This may be a loan from a non-AN source, but no promising candidate has been found.

009.	*aluyun ‘mutual aid, as in farm work or house-building’
IBL	__it__adoyon__/it__	‘system of mutual and reciprocal work (the farm family gains manpower by asking for help from their neighbors, and is in return obligated to reciprocate with work for their neighbors in their fields, repairing irrigation canals, building a house and the like)’
MSK	__it__aroyon__/it__	‘to help one another (in work activity)’

NOTE: This sparsely attested, but culturally important comparison, documents a practice that must have been all but universal in Neolithic societies, namely, the need for cooperative labor with work projects that everyone needed at some time, but no one could do alone, such as building a house, bringing in the harvest, and the like (as evidence that it extended beyond the Philippines, it is the national concept of __it__gotong royong__/it__ (mutual aid) in Indonesia.

010.	*amiliq ‘uncooperative’
IFG	__it__amíli__/it__	‘to avoid obedience, to refuse to be obedient’
BKD	__it__amiliɁ__/it__	‘choosy, not easily contented, fussy; to be choosy, fussy, etc.’.

NOTE: Possibly related to PAN *piliq ‘to choose, select’.

011.	*amúl ‘to suck on, as candy’
ILK	__it__ammól__/it__(< *am-amúl)	‘to hold in the mouth; play with s.t. in the mouth’

Arta	__it__amuluŋ__/it__	‘type of wild vine (substitute for betel nut)’
DgtC	__it__amulóŋ__/it__	‘type of vine chewed as a substitute for betel nut; it causes the spittle to turn black’
BKL	__it__amlóŋ__/it__	‘vine hanging from trees in the forest and used to make baskets’
HAN	__it__amlúŋ__/it__	‘any of several useful climbing ferns, some of which are used to blacken the teeth’.

NOTE: With unexplained loss of the medial vowel in in Bikol and Hanunóo.

013.	*amuŋ	‘dispute resolution; to resolve a dispute’
IBL	__it__amoŋ__/it__	‘to refer a case to the authorities, or to the council of elders for resolution (as land quarrel)’
WRY	__it__amóŋ__/it__	‘disturbance; the act of bothering; to be a party accidentally with untoward incident or situation’

014.	*anag ‘flavor’
ILK	__it__ánag__/it__	‘flavor; meaning; savor; characteristic property’
PLW	__it__anag__/it__	‘blandness, tastelessness’
MSK	__it__anag__/it__	‘spices; seasoning’

015.	*andurug ‘share space or feelings with s.o, put oneself in another’s place’.
KNK	__it__andulúg__/it__	‘to lie down with a companion’
BKL	__it__andúrog__/it__	‘to share experiences or feelings; to live vicariously’
MAR	__it__doro-dorog__/it__	‘adjacent; side-by-side’
WBM	__it__durug__/it__	‘to sit beside s.o.; the one who is sitting beside s.o.’

NOTE: I assume regular reduction of VNC- clusters in the antepenult of native Maranao and Western Bukidnon Manobo words.

016.	*antad ‘open and spacious terrain’
AKL	__it__antad__/it__	‘gap, distance, space’
TTB	__it__atar__/it__	‘open and spacious terrain’

017.	*apa ‘to be upset, defensive or angry’

IfgBt	__it__āpa__/it__	‘covetousness; jealousy; to begrudge, be covetous or jealous’
IBL	__it__apa__/it__	‘to be oversensitive, react defensively, become angry or upset upon being criticized, insulted or rejected’
BKD	__it__apa__/it__	‘to get upset and angry’

TAG	__it__ápaw__/it__	‘overflow; a flowing over; flood’
AKL	__it__ápaw__/it__	‘to exceed, go beyond; above one’s head (as river water)’

020. *apel ‘congealed blood, blood clot’

CEB	__it__ápul__/it__	‘coagulated blood’
MSK	__it__apul__/it__	‘blood’

AKL	__it__bágbag__/it__	‘to crash, come or fall down (as a plane that crashes)’

NOTE: DgtC __it__bagbag__/it__ ‘to overturn, to come apart in rough sea (of a boat at sea)’ probably is a Tagalog loan, but his is hard to apply to Ibaloy __it__bagbag__/it__.

028.	*báhiq	‘the hard, outer wood of a palm trunk, used in making bows’
ILK	__it__bái__/it__	‘bow; bowlike device used for fluffing cotton’

MSK	__it__báiɁ__/it__	‘kind of palm tree (inner part is soft, but outer part is hard)’

ILK	__it__baknís__/it__	‘to tear with the teeth’

032.	*bali-weswes ‘to rotate, turn around (of an object)’
ITB	__it__valiweswes__/it__	‘idea of being rotated’
IFG	__it__baliwohwo(h)__/it__	‘an apparatus with two standing rollers for pressing out the juice of the sugarcane (to make the rollers revolve a man pushes a long pole fixed to one roller, walking in a circle around the milling apparatus)’.

NOTE: Presumably with a variant of the *qali/kali- prefix (Blust 2001).

033.	*baluq	‘to mistake someone’s identity, have a misconception’
SblBt	__it__báloɁ__/it__	‘to be mistaken’
	__it__mi-báloɁ__/it__	‘one mistaken’

BKD	__it__ka-baluɁ__/it__	‘to misjudge s.t.; to expect s.t. to be a certain way when it is not’

NOTE: Whereas PMP *salaq and its PPH reflex appear to have referred to errors of __it__behavior__/it__, which might be reprehensible, since one has a choice in the matter, PPH *baluq appears to have referred to errors of __it__perception__/it__, over which one has no control. Reflexes of *salaq are therefore associated in some languages with guilt, or the Christian concept of ‘sin’, whereas the only reflexes of PPH *baluq known so far seem more likely to be associated with apology or embarrassment.

034.	*banaq ‘because, for the reason that’
SblBt	__it__bánaɁ__/it__	‘conjunction -- because; it is often followed by __it__ta__/it__ or __it__ha__/it__’
MSK	__it__bana__/it__	‘it is because; because of; in view of’

035.	*báŋan	‘fire saw, friction stick for starting a fire’
ILK	__it__báŋan__/it__	‘fire saw’
BtkP	__it__baŋán-un__/it__	‘friction stick used for fire making, used with fire thong’

NOTE: The Palawan Batak form is assumed to contain a reflex of the patient voice suffix *-en, sometimes used in nominalizations, as in PAN *Sikam ‘mat’, but BtkP __it__ikámun__/it__ ‘grass or woven leaf mat’, PPH *paŋan ‘food; to feed’, but BtkP __it__paŋán-un__/it__ ‘cooked rice’, or *turiq, but BtkP __it__turiɁ-ún__/it__ ‘circumcision’.

036.	*baŋen	‘barrier used to keep people out of a given area’
ILK	__it__baŋén__/it__	‘small fence to cover doors and stairs when children are present; any device that prevents one from passing by; obstruction’
KLY	__it__baŋen__/it__	‘wooden frame of fireplace’
WBM	__it__baŋen__/it__	‘a hindrance; to hinder’

NOTE: I assume that the *baŋen was a barrier used mainly to protect young children in domestic contexts from getting burned or falling from a height.

037. *baŋkíl ‘carry a load with a shoulder pole’
KNK	__it__baŋkíl__/it__	‘pole; to carry s.t. on the shoulder, the load being equal on each side’
IBL	__it__man-baŋkil__/it__	‘the action of two or more people carrying s.t. with a pole’
TAG	__it__baŋkíl__/it__	‘a large round basket used to carry coconuts, fruit, etc. on horseback’
BKL	__it__baŋkíl__/it__	‘k.o. basket for carrying food’
MAR	__it__baŋkil__/it__	‘packsaddle’
	__it__baŋki-baŋkil__/it__	‘laden with fruits, heavily pack by saddle’

NOTE: I assume that this form referred to carrying with a carrying pole across both shoulders, with an equal weight on each side. When horses were introduced by the Spanish, it was transferred to saddlebags slung across a horse’s withers.

038.	*baɁeg	‘barren, sterile’
KLY	__it__baweg__/it__	‘to be barren, to be unable to have children’
TAG	__it__baɁóg__/it__	‘sterile, barren, unproductive’

AKL	__it__báog__/it__	‘to putrify, rot (like old eggs)’
	__it__baóg__/it__	‘sterile (incapable of bearing children)’
WRY	__it__baóg__/it__	‘sterile; impotent’

039.	*bara-bara ‘move arms in a flailing motion, as in freestyle swimming’
ILK	__it__bára-bára__/it__	‘freestyle swimming’
	__it__ag-bára-bára__/it__	‘to swim freestyle’
BKL	__it__mag-bará-bára__/it__	‘to flail the hands, or wave the hands about; swim freestyle’.

040.	*barakílan ‘crossbeam in house construction’
ILK	__it__barakílan__/it__	‘horizontal rafter used in construction’
TAG	__it__balakílan__/it__	‘rafter; crossbeam or crosspiece of a house’
BKL	__it__barakílan__/it__	‘cross-beam’

NOTE: The likelihood that this is a Tagalog loan is reduced by the agreement of Ilokano and Bikol in pointing to *r, a phoneme which Tagalog had lost by merger with *l in the earliest Spanish records for languages of the Philippines.

041.	*batas ‘to cross a stream’
SblBt	__it__bátah__/it__	‘to cross a stream’
BKD	__it__batas__/it__	‘to cross over, go to the opposite side of something’

042.	*batás ‘to suffer, bear, endure’
SblBt	__it__batáh__/it__	‘to suffer, bear, endure’
HLG	__it__mag-batás__/it__	‘to bear, suffer, endure’
AKL	__it__batás__/it__	‘to endure, put up with, suffer’

043.	*batbat	‘invocation to the spirits’
KLY	__it__batbat__/it__	‘the name of an invocational ritual chant of the traditional religion’
IBL	__it__batbat__/it__	‘historically, a mostly curative ritual feast for a broad spectrum of lingering illnesse, done whenever divination indicates __it__batbat__/it__ is required’
WRY	__it__batbát__/it__	‘the act of leading in saying a prayer; to lead in a group prayer’

NOTE: This comparison neatly captures the semantic variation of cognate forms used by lowland Filipinos who have long been Christianized, and their montane relatives, who remained much less affected by the hispanization of the Philippines, and so continued until modern times to adhere to an animistic system of belief.

044.	*bayug	‘slender bamboo used for binding’
ILK	__it__bayóg__/it__	‘bamboo used for flooring; rattan strip used for tying’
	__it__na-bayóg__/it__	‘a tall and slender bamboo’

TBL	__it__bayug__/it__	‘k.o. small bamboo used for tying and building houses’

NOTE: Evidently distinct from PMP *bayuR ‘a tree: __it__Pterospermum__/it__ spp.’. Despite the statement that this bamboo is a recent introduction in western Bukidnon a source language remains unclear, since it has not been reported in either Tagalog or Malay.

045.	*bikal ‘k.o. slender bamboo’
ITB	__it__vichax__/it__	‘kind of bamboo (thinner)’
ILK	__it__bíkal__/it__	‘species of climbing bamboo: S __it__chizostachyum acutiflorum__/it__’

DgtC	__it__bikal__/it__	‘a species of uncultivated bamboo’
BON	__it__bíkal__/it__	‘a kind of bamboo'

046.	*bilbíl ‘rolls of adipose tissue in the abdominal or hip area’
ILK	__it__bilbíl__/it__	‘double fold in the upper stomachs of stout women’
TAG	__it__bilbíl__/it__	‘dropsy; a disease in which liquid collects in the body’
AGU	__it__bilbil__/it__	‘body fat found on the trunk’
CEB	__it__bilbíl__/it__	‘to make or be overly obese’
	__it__bilbil-ún__/it__	‘overly obese’
WRY	__it__bilbil__/it__	‘fatness of the hips’

NOTE: The probability that this is a Tagalog loan distribution is lowered by the divergence of the Tagalog gloss from that of all other languages.

047.	*bitwak ‘to lance, open up the flesh in an operation’
SblBt	__it__bitwák__/it__	‘to open up, as when dressing an animal; to operate’

TIR	__it__buaŋ__/it__	‘to loosen, to release s.t.’

050.	*buk(e)law ‘gluttonous, greedy with food’
ILK	__it__bukláw__/it__	‘gluttonous, greedy with food’

SblBt	__it__boklíd__/it__	‘to turn one’s foot over, to twist one’s foot’
MAR	__it__boklid__/it__	‘to topple, totter, tumble’

052.	*buneg	‘a tree with berry-like fruit that is fed to animals: __it__Garcinia__/it__ spp.’
ILK	búneg	‘k.o. tree whose fruits are fed to swine’
PLW	buneg	‘a tree: __it__Garcinia__/it__ spp.’

NOTE: Evidence that this is the same tree comes from the observation that trees of the genus __it__Garcinia__/it__ yield fruits that are a food source for many animals.

053.	*buntún ‘heap or pile, as of produce; to pile in a heap’

NOTE: Despite its currently known restriction to Greater Central Philippine languages and Casiguran Dumagat, it is unlikely that this word in the latter language is a borrowing from Tagalog.	Keeping trails clear of underbrush was traditionally a basic activity for foragers in their daily quest for food, and there would have been no motivation to borrow a word for such a key cultural concept from a language of higher prestige

NOTE: Also Bontok __it__kámat__/it__ ‘to stitch two edges together’, __it__na-kámat__/it__ ‘to be stuck together, of infected eyes’.	This word seems to derive from PAN *maCa ‘eye’, but not through any known process of affixation (compare e.g. Tagalog __it__ka-matá__/it__ ‘having the same type of eyes’, with prefix __it__ka__/it__ ‘mate, partner’).

119.	*kantuŋ ‘type of banana’

CEB	__it__kawkáw__/it__	‘to touch something with the hands’
MSK	__it__kawkaw__/it__	‘to touch s.t. in a container; to steal’

NOTE: This is potentially a Tagalog loan in Ilokano and Pangasinan, but the specific reference to washing the vagina in the latter languages, and not the former, disfavors this interpretation.

NOTE: Also Casiguran Dumagat __it__kayasukas__/it__ ‘rustling sound of paper or bushes; sound of dry leaves being walked on’. Ayta Abellen normally reflects *s as __it__h__/it__; I assume the absence of this change in __it__kayasakas__/it__ to be an onomatopoetic retention.

WBM	__it__ki__/it__	‘1st dl. topic pronoun’
BKD	__it__ki__/it__	‘1st dl. topic, you and me’

NOTE: The glosses given in the sources for Western Bukidnon Manobo (‘first person plural dual topic pronoun’) and Binukid (‘2du. topic; we, us (you and I/me) are self-contradictory, the first with regard to number, and the second with regard to person.	It seems clear that both are first-person dual topic pronouns, and that the Pangasinan form is a second-person topic pronoun connoting respect.	The common element in the two witnesses (Southern Cordilleran vs. Manobo) is second person topic.	Since PPH *ikaw is already well-supported in this function it must be assumed that *ki, which is far less robustly attested, had a less common function, hence the inference that it may have been a respect form, as in Pangasinan.	In any case a pronoun of this shape is currently unknown outside the proposed Philippine subgroup.

AKL	__it__máŋa__/it__	‘some, approximately, about (before numbers)’
CEB	__it__máŋa__/it__	‘about, approximately (before words referring to time or measurement)’

NOTE: Although this form is cited together with reflexes of PMP *maŋa ‘prenominal marker of plurality’ in some languages (as Cebuano), the meanings are different enough to merit separate treatment.	As an approximative marker *maŋá appears to have been used most commonly with expressions of quantity.

NOTE: Also Agutaynen __it__minta__/it__ ‘one time; once’.	This may be a Tagalog loan distribution, but the velar nasal in the Ayta Abellen and Botolan Sambal forms weighs against this interpretation.

NOTE: Also Palawano __it__nawi__/it__ ‘rattan’, Cebunao __it__náwi__/it__ ‘strip of rattan’; to cut rattan into strips’. PAN *quay ‘rattan’, which is far more robustly attested than this form, evidently referred to rattan in its natural state, while PPH *nawiq referred to processed rattan, that is, to rattan already been prepared for human use.

WBM	__it__patuŋ__/it__	‘a stock, i.e. a frame of wood with holes for the feet and hands to confine a prisoner’

NOTE: Possibly the same as PWMP *patuŋ ‘large, thick bamboo sp.’, but the reference to an instrument of punishment is not known outside the Philippines. Rubino (2000:450) is non-specific in his definition of “instrument”, but cross-references Ilokano __it__patóŋ-patóŋ__/it__ with Bontok __it__patóŋ__/it__ ‘to perch; to sit on an elevated place’, which implies that the Ilokano form refers to an instrument that is connected in some way to confining a person in a sitting position.

Mapun __it__pawud__/it__ ‘a section (about 6 feet long) of palm leaves sewn on a strip of bamboo, used for roofing’ is assumed to be a GCP loanword.

212.	*qalibun ‘a plant with medicinal value, probably __it__Blumea__/it__ spp.’
HAN	__it__alíbun__/it__	‘a tree (__it__Blumea balsamifera__/it__ Linn.); the leaves are boiled to make a beverage believed to stop malarial attacks’
AGU	__it__kalibon__/it__	‘kind of shrub with large pointed leaves which can be used for medicinal purposes; the leaves can be boiled and then the water drunk to relieve a cough or intestinal problems’

NOTE: Despite the geographical proximity of these languages, they belong to different primary branches of the proposed Philippine group, and given the phonetic difference between the forms in this comparison it is unlikely that they have been borrowed in either direction.

213.	*qalibuŋbuŋ ‘to encircle, surround something’
ITB	__it__alivovoŋ__/it__	‘idea of circling or circumscribing’
	__it__alivovoŋ-en__/it__	‘to encircle (as troops and the like)

IBL	__it__aliboŋboŋ__/it__	‘to be clustered, gathered (of people)’

NOTE: This word is assumed to contain the *qali/kali- prefix.

214.	*qalin-tatáw ‘pupil of the eye’
ILK	__it__alintatáo__/it__	‘pupil of the eye; imagination’
BKL	__it__(k)alintatáw__/it__	‘pupil of the eye’
HAN	__it__alintáwu__/it__	‘pupil of the eye’

NOTE: Also TAG __it__balintatáw__/it__ ‘pupil of the eye’.	This almost certainly is an *qali/kali- word (Blust 2001).	Although reflexes of PAN *Cau ‘person, human being’ are found more widely in the Austronesian family in words for ‘pupil (person) of the eye’, the use of a reduplicated base with the *qali/kali- prefix is known only in languages assigned to the Philippine group.	I assume that Hanunóo __it__alintáwu__/it__ shows haplology.

215.	*qalqal	‘migraine, or similar crippling pain’

PLW	__it__rikut__/it__	‘overgrown vegetation; things that are disorderly, in the way; encumbrance’

NOTE: Possibly the same cognate set as PWMP *rikut ‘grass’, but with a metaphorical extension that justifies a separate listing.

230.	*RakRak ‘to cut something loose from its attachment’
KLY	__it__laklak__/it__	‘to remove s.t. that is attached, as bark from trees, or banana stalks from banana plants’
MSK	__it__gakgak__/it__	‘to cut s.t. away, as a pig’s intestine to remove it from the stomach’

NOTE: Mapun __it__mag-sagid__/it__ ‘to brush against s.t. or s.o.; to touch (by brushing up against) is assumed to be a Tausug loan.

236.	*ság(e)qeb ‘bamboo internode used to fetch water’
IFG	__it__hágob__/it__	‘to get water from a spring (using a long bamboo water container)’
HAN	__it__sagɁub-án__/it__	‘any place from which water is procured’
AKL	__it__ságɁob__/it__	‘to fetch water; bamboo container about 2 meters long, used to fetch water – carried on shoulder’
CEB	__it__sagɁúb__/it__	‘a bamboo 6-7 feet long with nodes removed except at the bottom, used to fetch liquids’

NOTE: This culturally important term clarifies how water --- a daily necessity in domestic living --- was transported from a source to the house.	The use of a long bamboo tube allowed a large amount of water to be carried at one time, and the shape of the tube allowed relatively easy carriage over the shoulder.

237.	*sagság ‘the work of harvesting’; *ka-sagság-an ‘harvest season, season for major agricultural work’
DgtC	__it__ka-sagság-en__/it__	‘season for beginning or doing s.t. (as the harvest season, or planting season)
HAN	__it__sagság__/it__	‘harvesting’
	__it__ka-sagság-an__/it__	‘harvest, esp. the work involved at harvesttime’

NOTE: This comparison is at once immensely valuable as an indication of historical connection, and a source of puzzlement and frustration.	Both the quadrisyllabic shape of the stem in Casiguran Dumagat (which is cited as an unanalyzed lexical entry), and the synchronic evidence for the __it__ka- -an__/it__ circumfix in Hanunóo justify positing a disyllabic base *sagság and its affixed counterpart *ka-sagság-an.	It is unlikely that either the simple base or its affixed form functioned as the verb ‘to harvest’, as this meaning is represented by reflexes of PAN *qaniS over much of the Philippines.	Rather, the glosses suggest that *ka-sagság-an referred to that part of the annual cycle when the harvest (and possibly other types of socially-important group work activity) took place, leaving the gloss of the unaffixed base somewhat in limbo.	What is puzzling is that this comparison is attested so far only in these two languages, and since both chance and borrowing can effectively be ruled out as plausible explanations for the distribution, it is necessary to conclude that it was found in Proto-Philippines.

238. *sak(e)bit ‘to hang, suspend from something’
KNK	__it__i-sakbít__/it__	‘to hang, to hang upon, to hook’
HAN	__it__sakbít__/it__	‘hanging by hands and feet, or by the feet only, from a raised horizonal pole; a form of amusement among Hanunóo boys’

NOTE: With root *-bit- 1 (or *-beqit?) ‘to hook, clasp; grasp with fingers’.

239.	*sak(e)láw ‘to cut s.o. off, by blocking a path or stepping between two people’
ILK	__it__sakláw__/it__	‘to overtake by a shortcut’
DgtC	__it__sakláw__/it__	‘to interfere in the quarrel of others; to get involved in the problems of others’
TAG	__it__sakláw__/it__	‘limits; confines; the space within aboundary; the distance between limits; comprehension or inclusion’
TbwC	__it__saklaw__/it__	‘to head off something, to block’
CEB	__it__sakláw__/it__	‘to snatch at something, grab something away from someone’

NOTE: The chances of this being a Tagalog loan in Ilokano seem slight, given the semantic distance between these forms.

240.	*salagúntiŋ ‘scissor-shaped crosspieces used as roof supports or in animal traps’
DgtC	__it__salaguntiŋ__/it__	‘crossed vertical poles holding the spring of the __it__bilatek__/it__ trap (spring-set spear or arrow trap for wild pigs)’
HAN	__it__salagúntiŋ__/it__	‘a geometrical position in the form of an X’
AGU	__it__talagonsiŋ__/it__	‘to use scissors to divine information, similar to a Quija board’
AKL	__it__saeagúntiŋ__/it__	‘to question the spirits about something by putting scissors into a winnowing basket, which will then point to the person in question; thief, malefactor, etc.’
CEB	__it__salagúntiŋ__/it__	‘the principal rafters of a roof’
BKD	__it__salaguntiŋ__/it__	‘the principal rafters of a roof’
TIR	__it__salaguntiŋ__/it__	‘a roof truss in house construction’

NOTE: Also Tiruray __it__salaguntiŋ__/it__ ‘a roof truss in house construction’. This puzzling comparsion is one of the few quadrisyllables that does not contain the *qali/kali- prefix. It clearly contains *guntiŋ, which is widely reflected with the meaning ‘scissors’, but which apparently had much the same meaning as the longer word, as seen in Asilulu __it__guntiŋ__/it__ ‘the forked timbers that support a peaked roof’ and Malay __it__guntiŋ babi__/it__ ‘pig trap’. Once scissors were introduced the ‘X’ shape of the original referent was easily transferred to this new tool, which when opened shows the same configuration.

241.	*salaŋat ‘to interrupt mid-course’
PGS	__it__salaŋát__/it__	‘to answer; interrupt, intrude into, or join a conversation’
TAG	__it__saláŋat__/it__	‘caught between branches, and thus prevented from falling further’
MSK	__it__saraŋat__/it__	‘to get stuck (as a ball in a tree)’

NOTE: Despite their superficial semantic distance, these two meanings both refer to the physical or social interruption of something already set in motion.

242.	*sal(e)qaw ‘to encounter, meet by chance’
ILK	__it__ma-saláw__/it__	‘to meet, see s.o.’
	__it__ma-sal-saláw__/it__	‘unseen spirits met on the way’
BON	__it__salɁáw__/it__	‘to waste time, as in waiting to meet s.o. who doesn’t arrive as planned’
BKD	__it__salɁaw__/it__	‘to encounter, meet s.o. or s.t. coming from the opposite direction’

243.	*salikuŋkuŋ ‘funnel-shaped (?)’
ITB	__it__mis-salichoŋkoŋ__/it__	‘slightly concave’

HAN	__it__salúkub__/it__	‘tubular bamboo quiver for arrows, especially if poison-tipped’
MAR	__it__salokob__/it__	‘thimble’

NOTE: Also DgtC __it__salokop__/it__ ‘to cup s.t. over s.t. else (as to put a hat on the head, to cup a tin can upside down over a post or stick, etc.)’. With root *-kub ‘to cover’.

CEB	__it__saŋlád__/it__	‘run aground, stranded on the sand’
TSG	__it__mag-saŋlád__/it__	‘for a vessel to run aground’

NOTE: Yakan __it__s<um>aŋlad__/it__ ‘to have run aground, gotten stuck (in shallow water or on rock, of boats)’ is assumed to be aTausug loan.

247.	*saŋ(e)put ‘to come to the end (of a story, a race, etc.)’
PGS	__it__man-sampót__/it__	‘end; to end’

SblBt	__it__hapwát__/it__	‘to lift, to take up, to carry’
BKL	__it__mag-sapwát__/it__	‘to lift a container from the bottom’
BKD	__it__sapwat__/it__	‘to lift s.o. or s.t. from underneath (as a basket with a weak bottom, a sick person)’

250.	*saq(e)lap ‘to cast a net (in fishing)’
ISG	__it__s<um>aɁláp__/it__	‘to cast a __it__tabúkol__/it__ net (round casting net with sinkers at perimeter)’
AKL	__it__sáeap__/it__	‘net’, saeáp ‘to catch, capture’

251.	*sarabúsab ‘rude, inconsiderate’
ILK	__it__sarabúsab__/it__	‘thoughtless, inconsiderate; greedy eater’
WRY	__it__sarabúsab__/it__	‘having rude or rough manner or behavior; rude; impolite; gruff’

NOTE: This is a rare quadrisyllable without containing the *qali/kali- prefix, raising suspicions that it is a loan. However, no source is known, and the comparison itself is faultless.

252.	*saraw ‘to snatch food when an opportunity arises’
IBT	__it__ma-saraw__/it__	‘s.o. is gluttonous to eat or drink s.t. (as pigs being fed)’
BKL	__it__ma-saráw__/it__	‘describing dogs or cats which take food while people are eating’

CEB	sálut	‘cause stunted growth; to get sick, esp. by something that brings general body weakening and loss of weight’
AKL	__it__sáeot__/it__	‘evil; the work of the Devil. or evil spirits’

NOTE: I take the Aklanon gloss to be a residue of animistic beliefs about illness.

254.	*sawáliq ‘woven bamboo walling material’
ILK	__it__sawáli__/it__	‘interwoven splits of bamboo used in walls’
PGS	__it__sawáli__/it__	‘flattened bamboo made into mat-like panels serving as walling for traditional-type houses’

AKL	__it__sawáliɁ__/it__	‘woven bamboo’
TIR	__it__sawaliɁ__/it__	‘sheets of interwoven split reeds used for walling, sides of containers, etc.

NOTE: This word also is found in Chamorro, as __it__sagwaleɁ__/it__ ‘thatched house, usually made with __it__karisu__/it__ (swamp bamboo: __it__Phragmites karka__/it__)’. I take the Chamorro word to be a loan from Tagalog that was borrowed during the time of the Manila Galleon trade (1565-1815), as Safford (1905:334) notes that some types of walling material in Guam, including at least nipa palm thatch, were introduced from the Philippines.

NOTE: An intrusive medial vowel, like that in the Ibaloy form given here, is also seen in __it__ŋoliŋol__/it__ ‘to ruin a blade by chipping it, dulling it, etc.’ (cp. Ilokano __it__ŋulŋól__/it__ ‘dull, not sharp’). Alternatively, this vowel may have been lost in Hanunóo reflexes of “extended” reduplications, as in PPH *waŋáwaŋ ‘wide open space’, but Hanunóo __it__waŋwáŋ__/it__ ‘expansiveness, broadness, wideness, as of pools’.

264.	*sipet ‘to consume totally, use up’

	__it__sulít-en__/it__	‘win back one’s losses in gambling’
DgtC	__it__sulet__/it__	‘the replacement of something planted that has died or been uprooted (as to replant coconuts where the previously planted coconuts had been eaten by pigs; or for a child’s second teeth to come in after the first baby teeth had come out)’
BKL	__it__i-sulít__/it__	‘to return or put something in its proper place (used in the curse ‘May you return to your mother’s womb!’)

NOTE: Mapun __it__suŋaw__/it__ ‘a leak (esp. of air, but also of oil from an engine, cold from a refrigerator, etc.’, is assumed to be a Tausug loan.

HAN	__it__tarúk__/it__	‘dance, dancing’
	__it__mag-tarúk__/it__	‘to dance, will dance’
TbwC	__it__talɨk__/it__	‘dance’

NOTE: Also Kapampangan __it__terák__/it__ ‘dance’. The meaning of this term is unclear. In most languages it refers to traditional dancing without further specification. However, this is also true of Philippine reflexes of PWMP *sayaw. One possibility is that *sayaw referred to martial dancing, as it does in Ilocano, and *tadék to social dancing.	However, reflexes of *sayaw also refer to social dancing in many languages, raising the second possibility, which is adopted here, namely that *tadék referred to the graceful hand movements used in folk dancing, as its reflex does in Tagalog.

271.	*taed ‘natural cockspur’
IBL	__it__taed__/it__	‘short knife’
AGU	__it__taed__/it__	‘the sharp, horny claw on the back of a chicken’s leg’

ILK	__it__tagúban__/it__	‘quiver for carrying arrows’
HLG	__it__tagúb__/it__	‘sheath, scabbard’
AKL	__it__tagób__/it__	‘sheath, case, cover (for knife or sword); to sheathe, put into case’
MAR	__it__tagob__/it__	‘sheath’
	__it__tagob-an__/it__	‘scabbard, sheath’

NOTE: Also Tiruray __it__tabugan__/it__ ‘a scabbard’, which appears to be a Danaw loan. The stem here is clearly *tagub, but only *tagub-an can be reconstructed on the basis of evidence from two primary branches of the Philippine group, since the Ilokano form now appears to be monomorphemic.

273.	*taka ‘tired of, no longer interested in; lazy’
AKL	__it__taká__/it__	‘be bored with, fed up with, dislike’
AGU	__it__t<om>aka__/it__	‘to eventually stop, cease doing s.t.; become tired of doing s.t.’

AKL	__it__taeákid__/it__	‘to bundle together’

278.	*talakítuk ‘a sea fish: __it__Caranx__/it__ spp.’
ILK	__it__talakítok__/it__	‘k.o. small, speckled marine fish with dark meat: __it__Caranx__/it__ sp.’
TAG	__it__talakítok__/it__	‘a species of cavalla fish’
CEB	__it__talakítuk__/it__	‘k.o. fish, name given to jacks and other good-sized carangoid fish’
WRY	__it__talakítok__/it__	‘cavalla fish (__it__Caranx__/it__ sp.)’
MSK	__it__tarakitok__/it__	k.o. saltwater fish’

NOTE: Since __it__Caranx__/it__ species are found throughout the Philippines, and are not favored as food, there is no compelling reason to consider the name for them a Tagalog loanword in Ilokano.

279.	*tanáq ‘to rest, relax’
SblBt	__it__tanáɁ__/it__	‘to be quiet, to be still, to relax’
MSK	__it__tanáɁ__/it__	‘to rest’

283.	*tarabítab ‘idle talk, gossip’
ILK	__it__tarabítab__/it__	‘gossiper’
	__it__na-tarabítab__/it__	‘idle talking, chatty’
WRY	__it__tarabútab__/it__	‘the act of gossip or rumor-mongering; idle chat’

NOTE: The reconstructed penultimate vowel of this form is arbitrary. Despite its known occurrence in only two languages and the vocalic irregularity in the penult there can hardly be a serious question about whether these forms are cognate.

284.	*taray ‘to run’
ILK	__it__taráy__/it__	‘run; speed; operation or functioning (of a machine); drift; elopement’;
	__it__ka-taráy__/it__	‘to run away with; elope’
MAR	__it__taray__/it__	‘run’

285.	*tariktík ‘woodpecker’
ILK	__it__tariktík__/it__	‘kind of small bird’
BKL	__it__tariktík__/it__	‘woodpecker sp.’

NOTE: Probably onomatopoetic. With root *-tik ‘ticking sound’.

286.	*táru ‘beeswax’
Yami	__it__taro__/it__	‘candle, wax’
SblBt	__it__tálo__/it__	‘beeswax’
HAN	__it__táru__/it__	‘beeswax produced by the bee known as __it__putyúkan__/it__’

287.	*tarús ‘to understand, grasp something intellectually’
ILK	__it__tarús__/it__	‘to go straight to without delay’
	__it__i-tarus-án__/it__	‘to guess, arrive at, get to the true meaning; come upon; comprehend’
IBL	__it__teshosh-an__/it__	‘to be able to understand, follow s.t. (as lecture, sermon)’
PGS	__it__talós__/it__	‘to understand, interpret’
AA	__it__taloh__/it__	‘to understand something; meaning’
TAG	__it__talós__/it__	‘comprehended; perfectly understood; known; informed’

NOTE: Possibly identical to PWMP *tarus ‘continue doing something, proceed without stopping’. The two meanings are combined in some dictionaries, as Rubino (2000) for Ilokano, but separated in others, as in Ayta Abellen. Given its rather distinct semantics, which have so far not been found in any language outside the Philippines, I posit this entry as independent from PWMP *tarus.

288.	*tebúg	‘mud puddle, wallow for wild pig or carabao’
AgtaE	__it__tabóg__/it__	‘wallowing hole for wild pigs’
DgtC	__it__tebug__/it__	‘wild pig wallow’; t<om>bug ‘to go and wallow (of wild pigs)

TIR	__it__tebug__/it__	‘a stagnant pool of water; to make a pool to hold water’
TBL	__it__tebug__/it__	‘a stagnant pool of water, carabao wallow’

289.	*tel(e)tég ‘to tap down, pound down lightly’
ILK	__it__telteg-én__/it__	‘to thump, knock, strike’
BON	__it__teltég__/it__	‘a small mallet used for tightening the weave in basketry’

IfgBt	__it__toltóg__/it__	‘a pounding stone, used to pound small stone wedges into a stone toltóg wall or flagstone’
HLG	__it__mag-tultúg__/it__	‘to strike, to beat, to pound with considerable force’

CEB	__it__tultúg__/it__	‘to knock off the embers or ashes’

290.	*tepés ‘to suck out the contents of s.t., as juice from sugarcane’
ITB	__it__atpes-an__/it__	‘to suck well the juice of foodstuff in the mouth’
SblBt	__it__tepéh__/it__	‘to suck juice from sugarcane’
CEB	__it__tupús__/it__	‘to suck on s.t. in the mouth to eat it or get the juice out’
MAR	__it__tepes__/it__	‘to suck (as a child at the breast)’
MSK	__it__tupus__/it__	‘to chew (as sugarcane in order to get the juice)’
BKD	tepes	‘sugarcane pith (after sucking out juice)’
TTB	__it__tǝpǝs__/it__	‘to suck out contents (as flying foxes do with the flesh of fruits)’

NOTE: This word appears to compete with PAN *sepsep (which also has reflexes in Philippine languages) in the meaning ‘to suck’. However, *sepsep appears to have referred to sipping liquid from an open container, as soup from a bowl, or sucking liquid through a straw. By contrast, *tepes seems to have referred to sucking more solid contents out of something, as an egg from its shell or flesh from a fruit. The earlier comparison of Maranao __it__tepes__/it__ with Malay __it__tǝpas__/it__ ‘full up’ and Balinese __it__tepes__/it__ ‘squeeze, press, pinch’ is now abandoned, as the semantic fit is far better in the present comparison.

291.	*tíbaw ‘to visit traps to see what has been caught’
AA	__it__tibaw__/it__	‘to check on (e.g. a trap)’
SblBt	__it__tíbaw__/it__	‘to visit’

CEB	__it__tiŋíl__/it__	‘ask for payment; exact payment for what one has done’
WBM	__it__tiŋil__/it__	‘to collect a debt’

293.	*tipéd ‘to economize, be frugal’
ILK	__it__ag-tipéd__/it__	‘to economize, be frugal’
	__it__tipd-én__/it__	‘to conserve, use economically’
TAG	__it__tipíd__/it__	‘conservation, avoiding waste; way of saving money, time, etc.; thrift’
MAR	__it__tiped__/it__	‘pay in full’; tiped-an ‘pay in full, liquidate financial obligation’

NOTE: If they do not reflect a doublet, Casiguran Dumagat __it__tipíd__/it__ ‘to leave some to spare’, Bikol __it__ma-tipíd__/it__ ‘thrifty, parsimonious’, Aklanon __it__ma-tipíd__/it__ ‘to save, be thrifty with’, and Agutaynen __it__ma-tipid__/it__ ‘thrifty’ may be Tagalog loans, but the comparative evidence for last-syllable schwa suggests that this is not the case for Ilokano.

294.	*tub(e)liŋ ‘to arrange in rows’
SblBt	__it__toblíŋ__/it__	‘to plant in rows’
MSK	__it__tobliŋ__/it__	‘to arrange in a row; put in a line’

295.	*tul(e)dék ‘mark made with fingertip’
ILK	__it__tuldék__/it__	‘accent written over a letter; period (punctuation); point’
TAG	__it__tuldík__/it__	‘accent; a mark to indicate special stress’
BKL	__it__mag-tuldók__/it__	‘to prick, stick’
	__it__ma-tuldók__/it__	‘get pricked; get stuck (as by a pin)’
PLW	__it__tuldek__/it__	‘mark of your fingertip; a spot or mark made by the fingertip; spotted or marked; a period (at end of sentence), or other punctuation mark’

NOTE: Also TAG __it__tuldók__/it__ ‘period; full stop; a dot’. Since this word is surely older than the introduction of literacy to the Philippines, the references to punctuation marks must be secondary developments from an original sense which was most likely something like ‘mark made with fingertip; make a mark with the fingertip’, where the fingertip was dipped in paint or another marking agent to dab small amounts onto the skin or another surface.

296.	*tugun ‘advice, instruction’
KLY	__it__tugun__/it__	‘advice; command; to give advice’
IBL	togon	‘to advise s.o. with the idea of controlling him, or correcting a fault’
WRY	__it__túgon__/it__	‘instruction; advice; message’

NOTE: Also Itbayaten __it__toyon__/it__ ‘idea of message’. Apparently distinct from PPH *tugen ‘to deliver, send s.t. to s.o.’.

297.	*tultul	‘to hit, strike hard’
ITB	__it__toxtox__/it__	‘idea of pounding’
	__it__to-toxtox__/it__	‘wooden beater (for making bark cloth)’
IBT	__it__tohtoh__/it__	‘someone pounds something’
BON	__it__toltól__/it__	‘to peck, as one chicken pecking another’
KLY	__it__tultul__/it__	‘to strike s.t. with an instrument (as rice with pestle); to peck’
IBL	__it__toltol__/it__	‘to peck on s.t repeatedly (as chicken in eating)’

298.	*tup(e)rá ‘saliva, spit’
ILK	__it__tuprá__/it__	‘saliva, spit’
	__it__ag-tuprá__/it__	‘to spit’
WRY	__it__tuprá__/it__	‘saliva, sputum; the act of spitting’

NOTE: Although this comparison is currently limited to these two languages, it is without fault, and a number of similar, but non-corresponding forms, appear in other languages of northern Luzon (McFarland 1977: Map 2).

299.	*tustús ‘crisp, of fried food’
ILK	__it__tustús__/it__	‘crust of rice that sticks to the bottom of the pot’
BKL	__it__tustós__/it__	‘referring to well-fried or crisply fried food’

300.	*túyuq ‘to repent, regret one’s actions, turn against oneself’
KLY	__it__tuyu__/it__	‘to change mind about s.t. and stop doing it; to repent; for a person to be sorry about s.t. he has done’
IFG	__it__(tu)túyu__/it__	‘contrition, regret, repentance, self-condemnation’
WRY	__it__tuyóɁ__/it__	‘a feeling of discontentment or dissatisfaction; an ill feeling’

DgtC	__it__óhep__/it__	‘to repair or patch a hole in a roof’
AGU	__it__mag-orip__/it__	‘to repair woven material, such as nipa palm shingles on a roof, a mat, or a basket’
MAR	__it__orip__/it__	‘to reweave, patch up, repair a mat’

NOTE: Possibly a metaphorical extension of PAN *qudip ‘life, alive’, with irregular *q- > Ø, as in *qudaŋ ‘shrimp, lobster’ > __it__oraŋ__/it__ ‘small saltwater shrimp found close to the beach’. If so, this is a semantic innovation, and a highly distinctive one, as reflexes of *qudip are widespread in Austronesian languages, but are not known to refer to mending anywhere outside the Philippines.

302.	*ulit ‘to disobey, fail to follow orders’
DgtC	__it__ulit__/it__	‘to disobey and try to do again something that has been forbidden’
AA	__it__olit__/it__	‘hardheaded’
SblBt	__it__ólit__/it__	‘hardheaded’
	__it__maɁólit ka__/it__	‘said to one who doesn't quickly obey’
BKD	__it__ulit__/it__	‘to irritate, provoke someone to anger; to frustrate someone’

NOTE: Connected with reflexes of PWMP *ulit ‘repeat’ in some sources, presumably because one who disobeys requires repeated requests or warnings before complying. Also TAG __it__kúlit__/it__ ‘stubborn; obstinate; insistent; persistent’, __it__kulít__/it__ ‘continuously stubborn’.

303.	*umaw	‘mute, dumb’ (dbl. *umel)
PLW	__it__umew__/it__	‘mute, dumb’
TBL	__it__umew__/it__	‘mute, dumb’
MAR	__it__omaw__/it__	‘simple-minded, innocent person, dullard’
TSG	__it__umaw__/it__	‘dumb, unable to speak’

NOTE: Mapun __it__umaw__/it__ ‘mute, dumb’ is assumed to be a Tausug loan.

304.	*úŋut ‘coconut shell drinking cup or dipper’
ILK	__it__úŋot__/it__	‘scoop, made of a coconut shell’

IBL	__it__oŋot__/it__	‘bowl made from a half coconut shell (today the __it__oŋot__/it__ bowl is mainly used ceremonially in rituals)’
AA	__it__oŋót__/it__	‘the fruit, meat, or juice of the coconut’
SblBt	__it__óŋot__/it__	‘coconut’
KPG	__it__úŋut__/it__	‘coconut’

HAN	__it__úŋut__/it__	‘three-fourths of an empty coconut shell, used as a water dipper and drinking cup’
AGU	__it__oŋot__/it__	‘drinking cup or dipper made from a coconut shell’

	__it__urág-on__/it__	‘flirt’
CEB	__it__úlag__/it__	‘for animals to copulate; be in heat, crave intercourse’

NOTE: Possibly a Central Philippine innovation that has been borrowed into Hanunóo and various languages of Palawan and the Calamian islands. However, the semantic variation in these forms weighs against a borrowing interpretation.

306.	*urag-2	‘hyperactive, restless’
DgtC	__it__uhag__/it__	‘mischievous, restless’
AGU	__it__olag__/it__	‘somehone who jumps around a lot (as a child who can’t sit still)’

NOTE: Possibly identical to *urag-1, the former applying to adults and the latter to children.

ILK	__it__urbón__/it__	‘young (of animals)’
DgtC	__it__ógbun__/it__	‘baby bird’
