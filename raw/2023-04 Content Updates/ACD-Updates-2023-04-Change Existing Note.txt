25437		Malay biriŋ 'edge, e.g. of foot or boat' supports reconstructing *biriŋ rather than *bidiŋ, but with no other supporting evidence for such a reconstruction, the Malay form stands alone. It may be an irregular development from *bidiŋ.	
25662		Mongondow bulag 'albino' appears to belong in this set, but the irregularity of the final consonant, which would otherwise justify reconstructing *bulaR, cannot be rectified with the overwhelming evidence for *bulan.	
25714		Cebuano buntul 'small hill, top of a hill' may belong here, but the diverging semantics make it less likely. It may alternatively belong with PPh *buntud but either due to borrowing or with an irregular development of word-final *d.	
27815		Banjarese hisap and Lampung hisoʔ were previously used to reconstruct *qisep. However, considering Amis *hicep, the PAn reconstruction is mostly likely *hisep. Since there are few MP languages that actually retain PAn *h, it is  difficult to distinguish between *h- and *q- without diagnostic evidence from some PM language that maintains a distinction between these two. In the case of *qisep and *hisep, Lampung and Banjarese evidence were used to justify *q-, but the totality of the evidence now seems to support PAn *hisep which likely remained *hisep in PMP. The relationship between Lampung, Banjarese, and PMP *hisep is unclear, but the lack of expected *q reflexes in other languages like Malay and Javanese weaken their usefulness in reconstructing *qisep.	The meaning of *qisep-an remains unclear.
30401		Also note that Ilokano pispis 'temple of the head' and Bikol pispis 'sideburns' have an uncertain relation to PAn *piSpiS, since s in these languages cannot reflect *S, which became PMP *h. These words were previously used to reconstruct a doublet, PAn *pispis, but the Kavalan evidence is most likely part of the much better supported *piSpiS set, with Ilokano and Bikol seemingly unrelated.	
31318		Malay ikan lepu 'generic for a number of fishes with venomous fins, angler fish and goblin fish (Antennaridae and Scorpaenidae)' and Iban le-lepub 'fish with venomous fins, Angler and Goblin fish' may belong here, but lack an expected final -h from PMP *-q	
31788		superficially similar to POC *kodos 'go straight; straighten'	
32030		superficially similar to PMP *kedeŋ 'to stand; stretch out, as the body'	
32925			Also Lun Dayeh labi ‘a large freshwater mud turtle’.
25628		Karo Batak buis 'tug each other back and forth; pull, jerk' may belong here, but the word-final s in unexpected. The Karo Batak word was previously used to justify a doublet, *buis, but all of the evidence for that reconstruction was double listed with the better supported *bui reconstruction.	
25788		May also include Cebuano buntul 'small hill, top of a hill' and Toba Batak buntul 'arch, swell or vault upward' with an excrescent nasal.	
31338		Isneg píkat 'the sap of the jack, used for birdlime', Old Javanese pikat-an 'decoy' and a-pikat 'to catch birds, using a decoy',  Javanese pikat 'decoy bird; lure, trap', Balinese pikat 'lure, decoy, snare (for birds)' are all considered borrowings from Malay, which explains the irregular reflex of *e as well as the semantics which all deal with catching birds (from the root *-keC 'adhesive, sticky', in the case of Malay, a sticky substance used to catch birds, which was eventually narrowed to only 'catch birds'). These words were previously used to justify a doublet *pikat.	
26230		This cognate set assumes that there is irregular k/g crossover, with an original *g undergoing devoicing in numerous languages.	
30082		Selaru hayan 'bait' and Yamdena fayan 'beachworm; bait' were previously used to reconstruct two separate CEMP words, *bayan and *payan respectively. However, since both languages are found on the same island and the forms are irreconcilable with one another (Selaru h- : Yamdena f- is an invalid correspondence), borrowing in either direction is a viable explanation for these forms. Hypothetically, either CEMP *bayan or *payan could be supported, but not both. That leaves an unclear relationship between these two words, their supposed CEMP reconstruction, and the Oceanic forms which could belong to either set with the POC merger of *p and *b. Due to these issues, the form is restricted to Oceanic here, but may need further revision in the future if more evidence from eastern Indonesian is located. 	
25041		This may be an irregular development of *baRa 'pen, enclosure for domesticated animals' that is restricted to Sulawesi and Madagascar, although the distance between these two groups means that it would have to be a parallel development.	
		Blust (2000:96) notes that "Chamorro has no known reflexes of *r." This means that the Chamorro evidence here could be chance, evidence for *ziziq, or an instance of PMP *-r > -ʔ. Given the uncertainty surrounding Chamorro reflexes of *r, and evidence from Minangkabau in favor of *-r, *zizir is chosen as the representative reconstruction of what was previously reconstructed as a disjunct, PMP *zizir/*ziziq that shared the same Oceanic evidence.
